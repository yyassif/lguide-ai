### 60 seconds Installation ðŸ’½
  We will easily be able to deploy our product thanks to `Docker`.

- **Step 1**: Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yyassif/thinkai-lquide.git && cd thinkai-lquide
  ```

- **Step 2**: Copy the `.env.example` files

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- **Step 3**: Update the `.env` files

  ```bash
  nano .env # or emacs or vscode or vim
  ```

  Update **OPENAI_API_KEY** in the `.env` file.

  You just need to update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in the `.env` file. You can get your API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). You need to create an account first. And put your credit card information. Don't worry, you won't be charged unless you use the API. You can find more information about the pricing [here](https://openai.com/pricing/).

- **Step 4**: Launch the project

  All you'll need is to invoke the `docker compose`

  ```bash
  docker compose pull
  docker compose up -d
  ```

  If you have a Mac, go to Docker Desktop > Settings > General and check that the "file sharing implementation" is set to `VirtioFS`.

  If you are a developer, you can run the project in development mode with the following command: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`

- **Step 5**: Login to the app

  You can now sign in to the app with `admin@admin.com` & `admin`. You can access the app at [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login).

  You can access LGuide-AI backend API at [http://localhost:5050/docs](http://localhost:5050/docs)

### Detailed Instruction to start the dev locally

As you known FastAPI is a great tool for local development before being production ready.

- **Step 0**: Install python-pyenv && python-pipenv:

  Run the following command based on your os-convenience:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S python-pipenv python-pyenv # Arch users
  pip install pipenv pyenv # Windows users
  brew install pipenv pyenv # Mac users
  ```

- **Step 1**: Install python3.11 & create a virtual environment using pipenv accordingly:

  Install Python 3.11:

  ```bash

  pipenv shell
  ```

  Install dependencies (all packages) from `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock` if it exists:

  ```bash
  pipenv install
  ```

- **Step 1**: Launch the development server locally:

  Now all the dependencies are installed and ready to use, change directory to backend folder:
